*Last updated: 22 August 2024*

This Privacy Policy is intended to inform users of our approach to privacy in respect of this website ("Website"). In this regard, if you are visiting or interacting with our Website, this Privacy Policy applies to you.

This Website has been set-up by us for the purposes of gathering telemetry data from users of the Website about the reliability protocols utilised by Waku (such activity and related activity, being referred to as "Dogfooding").

Waku is a family of robust, censorship-resistant communication protocols designed to enable privacy-focused messaging for web3 apps. You can read more about Waku here: https://waku.org/.

## We limit the collection and processing of personal data from your use of the Website and for "Dogfooding" purposes

We aim to limit the collection and processing of personal data from users of the Website and your participation in Dogfooding. We only collect and process certain personal data for specific purposes and where we have the legal basis to do so under applicable privacy legislation. We will not collect or process any personal data that we don't need and where we do store any personal data, we will only store it for the least amount of time needed for the indicated purpose and in any event no longer than thirty (30) days.

In this regard, we collect and process the following personal data from your use of the Website and your participation in Dogfooding:

**IP address**: As part of such use of the Website, we briefly process your IP address. We however have a legitimate interest in processing such IP addresses to ensure the technical functionality and enhance the security measures of the Website. This IP address is not stored by us over time.

**Telemetry data**: We collect certain technical information (also referred to as telemetry data) to primarily determine the reliability (including, the performance and usage patterns) of the Waku reliability protocols for light clients. This information is only collected once you have accepted the prompt on the Website to participate in Dogfooding. Once you've accepted this prompt, a Waku node will start operating on your browser and then the technical information will start being collected by us.

The information collected includes:

- timestamps of receiving and sending messages;
- size of message packets;
- content topics/pubsub topics of the messages;
- code logs of errors and warnings; and
- a randomly generated temporary peer ID that represents your Waku node.

The temporary peer ID is a seeded identifier used for the duration of your participation in Dogfooding and allows us to correlate the obtained technical information with a particular session and with the additional information collected, could be potentially considered personal data. We process such data based on our legitimate interest to improve our software and the user's experience in respect of Waku.

If you do not agree to this data collection and processing, please do not interact with the Website or proceed with your participation in Dogfooding.

## Personal data sharing with third party service providers

We may share personal data with third party service providers in order for us to fulfil the above purposes. Such third party service providers act as data processors on our behalf and are only permitted to process personal data in accordance with our instructions and for the purposes specified above.

## Security measures we take in respect of the Website

As a general approach, we take data security seriously and we have implemented a variety of security measures on the Website that are reasonably designed to maintain the safety of your personal data when you submit such information to us.

In addition to the security measures of the Website, personal data is also protected by Waku (protocol) itself. You can read more about the security features implemented by the Waku protocol here.

## Exporting data outside the European Union and Switzerland

We are obliged to protect the privacy of personal data that you may have submitted in the unlikely event that we export your personal data to places outside the European Union or Switzerland. This means that personal data will only be processed in countries or by parties that provide an adequate level of protection as deemed by Switzerland or the European Commission. Otherwise, we will use other forms of protections, such as specific forms of contractual clauses to ensure such personal data is provided the same protection as required in Switzerland or Europe. In any event, the transmission of personal data outside the European Union and Switzerland will always occur in conformity with applicable privacy legislation.

## Your choices and rights

As explained in this Privacy Policy, we limit our collection and processing of your personal data wherever possible. Nonetheless, you still have certain choices and rights in respect of the personal data which we do collect and process. As laid out in relevant privacy legislation, you have the right to:

- Ask us to correct or update your personal data (where reasonably possible);
- Ask us to remove your personal data from our systems;
- Ask us for a copy of your personal data, which may also be transferred to another data controller at your request;
- Withdraw your consent to process your personal data (only if consent was asked for a processing activity), which only affects processing activities that are based on your consent and doesn't affect the validity of such processing activities before you have withdrawn your consent;
- Object to the processing of your personal data; and
- File a complaint with the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC), if you believe that your personal data has been processed unlawfully.
